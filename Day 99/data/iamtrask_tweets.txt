I recently gave an interview to on my views on:

- how to get into Deep Learning
- the importance of privacy and Private AI
- a bit of my personal back story

I hope some of these tidbits are useful for beginners looking for direction in their AI careers

Machine Learning is WAY more than just picking a model & calling .fit() or .train() on data

It's a process...  thinking about your problem in terms of correlation & features

This step-by-step guide is an excellent intro to this process

Hypothesis - major Deep Learning discoveries in the last ~decade fall into two categories:

1) better learning bias (usually by strategically re-using weights)

Convnets, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Attention, CapsNet, Dropout...

2) more training data

GANs, GPUs, word2vec, ImageNet...
---
Several great blogs have been written about LSTMs - this one (in my opinion) has the most intuitive diagram for how LSTMs actually work under the hood - it's a *semantic* diagram instead of just showing the formulas.

Just came across an interesting theory on why Deep Learning generalizes so well, recently published.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08522 

Background:http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/%E2%80%98simplicity-bias%E2%80%99-science …

If you're interested in being ahead of the curve on this movement, come over to @openminedorg
http://slack.openmined.org/ 
---
And I don't feel confident enough in attempts to scale decentralized VMs to say they could be within orders of magnitude of modern GPUs in terms of $ cost or runtime performance. Cryptography more generally, however, feels imminent and accessible.
---
Note - I exclude blockchain from this assessment, mostly because at the time of writing it has no bearing on trust models for private assets (people are working on this) and is impractically slow for use with AI. This might change, but that's my current thought.
---
Opening up the trust model will further cause an explosion of research by opening up new datasets to train on (which is the primary constraint on research). This will (by extension) create a subsequent boom in A.I. entrepreneurship.
---
Cryptography will completely change this. Users won't have to trust companies with their data. Companies won't have to trust users with their models. Models will be able to have multiple owners (enforced cryptographically), even controlled by votes of ownership/equity like stocks
---
Current AI tools force a single trust model on all users. All data for training or prediction, all predictions of the model, and future use of AI models themselves are entrusted to the same entity, the model owner (which is always just one entity, the person who owns the machine)
---
Precedence for the speed of mature fields which converge can be seen with the recent convergence of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. Cryptography is a much larger field than RL with extremely far reaching implications.
---
IMO, the next big thing in A.I. is a convergence with #cryptography. Tools for intelligence and tools for trust will make for powerful social good. 

IMO, this convergence will happen very quickly because #cryptography and A.I. are mature fields with many great ideas to combine.

And I personally have found that I understand Mathematics far better when learning in an applied context as opposed to an abstract one, and that my time in Deep Learning has greatly enriched my understanding and love for Mathematics more than the other way around.
---
Note that this is in no way because I think math is a poor tool for teaching, using, or researching Deep Learning. I merely believe that to become a user of Deep Learning much of the math can be learned along the way, and you can use tools like numpy to help teach it.
---
For anyone interested, I'm (mostly done) writing a book which teaches Deep Learning using intuitive examples more than math. All code examples are on Github, written from scratch in Numpy

If you think this is your learning style, you can download it here: https://goo.gl/xa3Vey

Will AGI be a discrete event (like... AGI happened on X day at X time) or will it be a slow progression into something that seems like AGI?

I think it's plausible that DJs will be replaced with AIs and that the transition could be quite fast. DJs rose to popularity so quickly because the cost of touring is a fraction of that required for a band. End-to-end music generation is merely the next step.

The regulation arbitrage is that the government has yet to catch up to regulating big businesses masquerading as small ones - (i.e., enforcing safety/security policies for AirBnbs like they do hotels, enforcing benefits for full time employees). It's the consumers that lose out
---
AirBnb, Uber, and Blockchain share something in common. They are copies of businesses that already existed - and the main competitive advantage is the ability to avoid capex & regulation by shifting the burden of both to consumers.

IMO - this is a short lived advantage

Thus, plants are attempting to Generate samples that seem poisonous, while animals are attempting to Discriminate poisonous from non. This battle for meaning also seems to happen elsewhere.

Smell/taste in nature reminds me of GANs. Plants are (presumably) trying to send off a scent/taste encoding the meaning "don't eat me! I'm poisonous" while animals are (presumably) trying to decode from the taste/smell which plants are actually poisonous or delicious.

Very inspired by OpenAI's new charter.https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/

Yesterday I gave an overview of OpenMined on the MLMU Youtube Livestream. If you're interested in Privacy and Artificial Intelligence you might find it interesting.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oggJP1Z6DLg …
---
This is one of the great things about a republic. Everyone gets a voice, but there's also a process through which individuals are held accountable. Not a perfect system, but pure decentralization is not an improvement.
---
The illusion that everyone is in direct control through voting also decentralizes accountability. This hurts transparency and fairness. A world in which no-one is at fault for tragic events is not a good one.
---
Decentralized leadership is like all 6 passengers grabbing the wheel at the same time arguing over where we should go.

51% may get what they want, but they might drive off a bridge in the process. And by 51%, I mean 51% of the strength, not 51% of the people. (2/2)
---
Centralized leadership is like a selfish taxi driver that charges unfair prices or kicks passengers out early, but in a transparent market bad behavior is a competitive disadvantage. Transparency promotes fairness, and the passenger is, in the long run, the one in control. (1/2)
---
Anonymous Proof-of-Stake and Anonymous, Decentralized Betting markets are fundamentally rule by the rich. If you can write a big enough check, you can cause anything to happen. I fundamentally disagree that these mechanisms create fair and transparent markets.
---
I came across a rather extraordinary gem today.

"Fair Decentralized Concensus Is Impossible" - a small, formal proof by @BenLaurie (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Laurie  ) 

http://www.links.org/files/dpoi.pdf 
---
I really hope privacy is a solved problem before we get to ubiquitous brain-computer interfaces.https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/981964188607270912 …
---
Fun fact - it costs over $300,000 to upload MNIST to the Ethereum blockchain.
---
It just seems like the marketing machine behind Proof of Work/Stake can only last so long - at some point it has to have a better cost/risk profile - and it seems like centralized sources + cryptographic transparency are going to have both lower cost and lower risk.
---
And to boot - the services they provide tend to be more efficient.
---
However, transparent centralized sources lose reputation - which is a proxy for *all future cashflows*. Anonymous 51% members lose a well defined amount... centralized sources put it all on the line every day.
---
I've recently been wondering if enforcing transparency of centralized sources (using cryptography) might actually be a better solution.

Proof of Work/Stake only forces each member of the crowd to lose whatever they "stake". (cont.)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/88wbkv/electroneum_is_probably_under_a_51_attack_right/ …
---
The Decentralization movement seeks to change who is in control under the assumption that the majority of the crowd (51%) will not *decide* exploit the minority of the crowd (49%) for profit.

I think history has shown us that this is a risky assumption.
---
I'm interested in actionable research comparing healthy social interactions with what digital tools encourage. Specifically I'd like clarity on both the good and the bad and how I can measure the impacts in my own social interactions
---
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance …

"The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data."
---
Happy Easter!!!
---
Lots of folks are optimistic about #blockchain. I recently came across a difficult question...

If a zero-knowledge proof can prove to users that a centralized service performed honest computation, why decentralize it? 

We live in free markets... I see a correction coming...
---
There's a hidden gem about blockchains in this blogpost.https://deepmind.com/blog/trust-confidence-verifiable-data-audit/ …
---
There's a lot of conversation happening around privacy (or lack there of it) these days - if you're looking for the next big thing in AI research - my money is on Privacy-Preserving AI. 

The two big subjects there are Differential Privacy and Federated Learning.
---
Takeaway - The future of Marketing is word-of-mouth using privacy preserving technologies. If you're in Marketing and want to innovate, invest in knowledge around these new tools!
---
Fast, cheap, privacy preserving word-of-mouth is the greatest threat to the current Marketing industry, and the greatest opportunity to the health of society. It may even include social transparency (i.e. are Instagram influencers actually happier because of their stuff?) (3/3).
---
In the future, privacy preserving technologies will eliminate arbitrage opportunities between buyer and seller by allowing sellers to privately share aggregate information about products and services without anyone disclosing their own personal preferences (2/3).
---
The relationship between Buyer and Seller of a product/idea/political agenda is based on a "Claim" from the Seller that a product will achieve an outcome for the Buyer which may or may not be entirely accurate. In practice its often exaggerated. (1/3)
---
Truly great work coming out of the Ethics and Society group at @DeepMindAIhttps://medium.com/@Ethics_Society/the-case-for-fairer-algorithms-c008a12126f8 …
---
Although hidden markov models certainly have some of this going on
---
I'm not sure the same can be said for many other counting-based mechanisms which update their internal state irrespective of what the current state actually is (such as simple frequency distributions)
---
Perhaps a reason neural nets learn so efficiently is because they learn by trial and error. During training, each forward propagation is not just conditioned on the input, but also on the current state of the weights, which is subtly conditioned on every example seen so far.
---
Private ML Google of the Day - "Bayesian Truth Serum"
---
I believe this paper will be one of the most important Privacy-preserving ML papers of the year. Proposes practical methods for measurement and defense.

FWIW - Neural Networks were black boxes to me until I tried to make one from scratch without looking at a reference. It was painful (and humbling) at the start but it helped me realize how the little moving parts work together.

For new and old - I highly recommend this exercise

If you're interested in Private AI, here's a great (and growing!) list of resources put together by @gavinuhmahttps://github.com/OpenMined/awesome-ai-privacy/blob/master/README.md …

10 years from now - who will have primary control over consumer data?

Just discovered @dat_project - easily one of the coolest projects out there for the Web 3.0. I remember @BeakerBrowser but this new project is a whole new level.

it's amazing to think how many billions (trillions?) of dollars a year are spent building infrastructure for no other reason than humans are dishonest - cryptography, prisons, VMs, locks, doors, fenses, walls...

... i wonder what % of the GDP is driven by this.

Often I have a hard time coding when listening to music with words - so I tend to listen to a ton of movie scores...

Does anyone know why GANs aren't solving for adversarial attacks? It's a loss function that explicitly exists to do so...https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/967123354661535744 …

Networks that build and enforce trust are more efficient (and by extension valuable) than networks that require no trust - which are often un-necessarily slow via irrelevant participation. I propose:

Verifiable Accountability > Decentralization

I'm 5 minutes into using Jupyter Lab - it's so amazing.... it has everything I ever wanted in Jupyter.

I contemplated not sending this tweet on the off chance it hurt future job prospects - but tbh - I think I'd rather hire someone under-qualified who was expecting bust his tail learning on the job (who will likely continue to be a high-growth employee) than the opposite.
---
I don't think I've ever applied for (or accepted) a position that I felt I was 100% qualified for - if I don't think I'll have to grow/learn a bit - it's probably not worth my time.

There's obviously a limit - but I think it's good food for thought if you're on the job hunt.
---
I can't begin to describe my excitement about this announcement - I'm a huge Jupyter fan -https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906 …
---
I think this is useful to consider - many tasks in AI aren't limited by effective Models - they're limited by effective training data. Occasionally we can make models that help us with that. RL is a great example.
---
Deep RL (esp pol grad) is useful because it creates labeled training data for tasks that would otherwise be hard to do so. A dataset for every muscle a robot should move in order to walk is hard... a detector for whether an agent walked through a door is easy.

Loss function patterns are very mysterious things - particularly when they appear to be diverging... only to reverse and descend to a new low. How in the world do gradient based methods know to climb in order to descend... that's still pure magic to me.

I feel like a significant percentage of Deep Learning breakthroughs ask the question "how can I reuse weights in multiple places?"

- Convolutional layers reuse in multiple locations. 
- Recurrent (LSTM) layers reuse for multiple timesteps
- Capsules reuse across orientation.

So much of the web has nothing to do with the content - and everything to do with the peer pressure of "here's how greatly the rest of the world values this thing"

and can you imagine what a competitor could do with this up against a company like @Elastic or @Oracle ?
---
That's a huge realization - I consider it to be a race for whoever can make the library that makes this kind of tech ubiquitous..., we need this supported in Python by default - yesterday.
---
even the scale of these claims is hard to imagine - and hard to rectify with trends like moore's law - time will tell whether these percentages are the norm - but it wouldn't surprise me. As he points out, most data structures are engineered to assume the worst.
---
So many problems come down to performance/RAM - if he believes that we can improve upon core data structure performance like this - and bake it into hardware - it's a wholesale upgrade to what is computationally feasible so an unbelievable number of systems... simultaneously.
---
And it's not just what the paper says - but the "who" that is saying it. Jeffrey Dean is in the position to actually realize this technology into ubiquity.
---
This paper is an absolute monster - the trickle-down implications of an advancement this low-level and general purpose are too great to imagine at this point. Truly in awe.
