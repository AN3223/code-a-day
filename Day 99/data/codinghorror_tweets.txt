After about three full cycles of going through the park this way, and struggling to enter the password every time on each ride (lots of failed attempts), I was very glad to finally wake up.

The only way to disable the scary/broken rides was to use a super mega awkward UPS style handheld data entry device, rotated on its side, and enter the term “comixology”. And you could only do this after entering each ride, and it started griefing you.

And I kept getting stuck at the end of the park such that I had to go through 4-5 of these rides to get back to the rest of the team.
