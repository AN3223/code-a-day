It doesn't matter if you're 7, 17, 27, or 77 years old, it's never too early or too late to start learning AI. Have a question? Ask it. Encountered a bug? Solve it. Can't understand a concept? Learn it.
---
I want to see you Wizards become ML superstars. That means publishing admirable research papers, keynote speaking at conferences, creating educational content, and creating sustainable businesses around AI. The clock is ticking, make the ML community proud!
---
The #100DaysOfMLCode movement is really taking off! If you've already committed, try asking 1 close friend to commit as well. You can help keep each other accountable and it'll increase the likelihood you'll complete the challenge.
---
I have a very math focused video that compares loss functions coming out later this week.
